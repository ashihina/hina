In our study, the initial step (consistent with the reference paper "bottom to top" mechanism) involves the addition of water to the protonated oxime OH group attached to the central carbon in MIN2. This leads to a proton transfer to the nitrogen of the oxime group, resulting in the formation of MIN3, which is the rate-determining step for our scheme, as highlighted in the red-boxed region below.

**Figure 3**: Illustration of the transition state (TS) formation inside (red box), depicting the base-mediated proton abstraction from the hydroxyl group, which weakens the C-N bond, leading to the release of NH₂OH.

**In our study**, water serves as a base to abstract a proton from the hydroxyl group, thereby weakening the C-N bond. Simultaneously, the release of NH₂OH proceeds with an energy barrier of 21 kcal/mol.

**Figure 4**: By adding water in MIN3 to release NH₂OH and H₃O⁺, the final product, a ketone, is formed.

## Conclusion

Our computational study elucidates the mechanism of nonmetallic catalytic oxime release and C−C activation, revealing critical role of water as a acid/base in proton transfer (abstraction from the protonated oxime OH group in MIN2, leading to MIN3 formation as **the rate-determining step**). Subsequent base-mediated proton transfer weakens the C-N bond, facilitating NH₂OH release with a **21.99 kcal/mol**energy barrier, ultimately yielding the ketone product. These findings highlight an efficient and green pathway for constructing Ketone from oxime.
